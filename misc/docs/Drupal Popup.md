Drupal Popup

*Popup* and *Popup block* are good for making tooltips, but don't do an on load pop up as required.

*Popup onload* does but the initial results are really crap - takes too long to load, looks terrible. Presumably that's all configurable/editable, but it isn't really obvious how, short of direct editing the css. NB requires *colorbox*.

*Splashify* - requires *jstorage* library which is deprecated. I tried it anyway but no dice.

what a fucking waste of time
